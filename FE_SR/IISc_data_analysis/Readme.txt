-> IISc_data : contains the raw data measured from IISc
-> Run the SR_simulation/run_sim.py to generate simulation data.

## The paramete_IISc is the parameter parse file. (finalized parameters)

## gen_time_ser_data.py have the code to generate the raw time series data by simulating the TDGL equation.

## analysis_data.py have the code to perform the analysis on the generated data (and the experimental data as well).

-> DEV_IISC_plots.ipynb generate all the plots required. (may have to change some paths inside the code)
