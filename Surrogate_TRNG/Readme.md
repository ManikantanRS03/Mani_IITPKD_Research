-> Spice_python_simulation
    . Contains simulation of the surrogate circuit automated through a Python script to generate:
        - Kramers time plots
        - TRNG plots

-> TRNG_controller
    . Contains the BTP work carried out in Sem 7/8. Modified the surrogate circuit to incorporate a        
    digital control mechanism (details of implementation in the report provided)
        - PCB design (KiCad)
        - Measurements done on the setup (more details in the README inside)
        - Noise generation code for the Innovation Lab function generator
        - MATLAB/Simulink simulations to test the control design
